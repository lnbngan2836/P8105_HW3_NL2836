Load the necessary libraries and datasets.
```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

# Problem 1

### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

Count the number of distinct aisles.
```{r aisle count}
aisle_count = 
instacart %>% 
  summarize(n_distinct(aisle))
```

Arrange the `aisle` variable according to observation frequencies and output the first (highest frequency) row.
```{r aisle frequency count}
aisle_most_order =
  instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(frequency = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(frequency)) %>% 
  pull(aisle) %>% 
  first()
```

There are `r aisle_count` different aisles. The aisle from which most items are ordered is `r aisle_most_order`.
